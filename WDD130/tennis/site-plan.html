      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>A professional tennis coach needs a website to provide information about his services as well as provide his qualifications and contact 
        information to potential clients.  So, as a web designer, I want to make a better website for you.  I know that you are a 
        tennis instructor and you have a small online presence through social media but you really should have a personal website for your company.
        Everyone should be able to search your name and find your website with information about your services.  Links to your social media, 
        especially Instagram and Facebook should increase your business. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience is parents, children, high school coaches, anyone interested in tennis instruction.  Very often, parents and coaches are
      looking for extra training for their children and a private coach is just the solution.  Adults who may want to improve their game also 
      might want a private instructor.  Even professionals pay for private instruction.  Everyone can improve.  It should be easy to type in "tennis coach"
      to a search engine and find a coach near you.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        I want the font to be professional and serious, no handwriting type or comic sans for this site!  Roboto is a little

        Here at PlayITForward we believe in coaching for everyone. Coaches help you to improve no matter your 
        skill level, even professionals.  Serena Williams, one of the best tennis players in the world, 
        has a coach. Coaches make the difference.  A coach is someone who is watching from the outside, 
        who can analyze your technique, footwork and stroke and make recommendations based on their 
        knowledge and expertise.  A personal coach can be the difference for you, between your 
        best casual game with friends, or becoming the best player at your school.  It’s your 
        time and your money and you want to spend it wisely.  So, we welcome you to  Play it 
        forward where you’ll find what you’re looking for in coaching and progress.

        About Tennis--A History
      </h4>
      <p>
        Tennis is believed to have originated in France among French monks who played a crude handball 
        against monastery walls.  It was originally called jeu de paume or “game of the palm” because
        they hit the ball with their hands.  It was probably painful to repeatedly hit the balls with
        their hands, so after trying a glove, eventually the monks graduated to using a racket.  
        The balls were made of hair, wool or cork wrapped in string or cloth.  The French nobility 
        learned the game from the monks and it spread to England.  That early game differed from the
        “lawn tennis” we play today, it’s called “real tennis” and is played on an indoor court. 
        Tennis’ popularity waned in the 1700’s until it enjoyed a revival in 1850 with the 
        invention of rubber. That is when the outdoor tennis game became possible. Of course, 
        outdoor games couldn’t use the walls and whole new set of rules were created.  In 1874, 
        London Major Walter Wingfield patented equipment for a game very similar to the tennis 
        we play today.  Within a few years, his equipment had been sold and installed in the US, 
        Russia, India, Canada and China.

        <strong>What’s the deal with the love?</strong>  Anytime there is a score of zero it is referred
        to as love. There are a few theories as to why.  One theory is the French expression for egg-l’oeuf.  
        A zero looks sort of like an egg and apparently some people beleive the pronunciation of l’oeuf got 
        butchered so much over the years it became love.
      <p>
        Another theory is that love really just means for love of the game.  When you have zero points, 
        the only thing keeping you playing is the love of the game.
